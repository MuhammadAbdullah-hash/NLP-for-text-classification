# NLP-for-text-classification
Welcome Back ! 
This Model is trained to classify  a data set of tweets as "Disastorous" or "Non-Disastrous". I have trained my model using KAGGLE Data set.
I am Attaching train.csv , and test.csv files. Training data consist of about 8000 tweets and test data contains almost 3400 tweets. Model classifies 80 % of tweets correctly.
We can increase accuracy of model by cahnging number of epohcs and embedding layers
